      The stationary bike attempts to recreate the experience of riding a bicycle without ever having to move from one spot. The buttons on the left handle allow the rider to pause/stop the ride, and the buttons on the right handle allow the rider to increase/decrease the time left on the ride. The buttons on the main console include the functionality of the handles and more, including modes and pausing the ride. The two sets of handles offer the rider different ways of holding the bike while pedaling. The lever beneath the seat allows the rider to adjust the seat height, and the pedals allow the rider to cycle.

      <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">1. When asked about the handles, all three respondents described the horizontal handles as better for easy riding, while the vertical handles would be for more intense riding.</li>        
        <li class="list-group-item">2. When asked about confusing buttons, some combination of the mode buttons was mentioned by every rider, the rolling hill ride in particular. Every user did hazard guesses for some of the modes, with varying success.</li>        
        <li class="list-group-item">3. When asked how to adjust the seat, all three respondents used the yellow tongue lever underneath the seat. However, one interviewee remarked that she would not have thought to adjust the seat had she not been prompted.</li>        
        <li class="list-group-item">4. Two of the riders, when asked, responded negatively about the beeping that accompanied the countdown. One said that it was unnecessary, and the other that it drew unwanted attention toward the rider.</li>        
        <li class="list-group-item">5. When asked how to stop the bike, two riders used the big red button on the console, but one rider used the stop button on the left handle. When I pointed out that button to the other two riders, they both seemed surprised, as if that second stop button had gone unnoticed by them.</li>

                Fig. 2: Active Arlene, a point guard and team captain of her college basketball team adamant on leading her team to nationals, rides the stationary bike at a low-intensity pace to stay limber when she’s off the court during games.

                Arlene is not interested in creating the perfect ride; she just wants to start riding as quickly as possible to stay warmed up and also to avoid burning out her legs. She is distracted by the ongoing game, so the few buttons she needs must be clearly demarcated.
              </p>
              <p>
                Arlene represents the low-intensity rider that each interviewee ascribed to the horizontal handles. Moreover, she incorporates the user that immediately pressed the green button and started pedaling. Also mixed in is the other user who said she did not think about readjusting the seat.

                Fig. 3: Bike Mike (i.e., Bicycle Micycle) is a retired librarian—hence he hates loud noises—who is training for a road racing event, but a recent spate of summer showers has him impatiently trying out the stationary bike at his local gym for the first time.

             <p>
              Mike wants to have a ride similar to what he experiences on his bicycle outdoors, so he is willing to take some time to explore the mode buttons that Arlene ignores, but he does not have a manual, and his patience is thin.
             </p>
             <p>
              Mike represents the high-intensity user that was ascribed to the vertical handles. He incorporates the users whose first instincts were to look at the console and expressed some confusion at the mess of buttons, as well as the user who investigated the buttons on the handlebars. He also incorporates the two users who expressed dissatisfaction with the beeping, thus Mike doesn’t like loud noises.
